					<td><font size="5" align="center">A motherboard is the main PCB in the computer. It is also known as the mainboard, logic board or system board. It consists of components that allow communication between components such as processor, memory and other peripherals. The motherboard contains chipset, memory controllers, interface cards such as sound cards, video cards, network cards, and other components integrated together.</font></td>
					<td><font size="5" align="center">The processor is also known as the Central Processing Unit ( CPU). It handles the functionality of other components on your computer. There are two subsystems in the processor called the Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) and the Control Unit (CU). ALU performs arithmetic and logic operations. To synchronize activities, the CU sends timing and control signals to the other components.Moreover, there are fast memory locations called registers inside the processor. They help to store and transfer data to other units as instructed by the CPU.The processor's execution unit is called the heart. A processor can have a single core or several cores. A single core processor is a single processor. A two-core processor is called a dual-core processor. A four-core processor is considered a quad-core processor. Many of the latest processors have several cores to execute several instructions simultaneously.</font></td>

					<td><font size="20" align="center"> Function</font></td>
					<td><font size="5" align="center">The motherboard has several slots and connectors and acts as the core of the operating system. Each piece of hardware on the computer connects to the motherboard and relays the data between the components. Most motherboards now have chipsets for processing audio data, removing the need for a separate sound card. For older machines, motherboards often included graphics processing ,but today's computers use either separate graphics cards or graphics technology built into the processor.</font></td>
					<td><font size="5" align="center">The CPU performs most of the computations and functions that allow a computer to run its operating system and any installed programs. In some computers, the processor handles all data for the system, while in others, add-in cards, such as graphics cards, offload some of the work to speed up the system Apart from the work that relies on a graphics card, the speed of the processor is the most important factor in determining the speed of the computer.</font></td>

					<td><font size="20" align="center">Compatibility</font></td>
					<td><font size="5" align="center">Most of the other components on the computer, such as hard drives and RAM, also require compatibility with the motherboard. For example, an old IDE hard drive can not connect to a modern motherboard with SATA drive ports. While the processors have some compatibility concerns — some RAM models may not work with certain CPUs — the motherboard determines the vast majority of compatible parts.In essence, you need to select all the components in your computer based on your motherboard.</font></td>
					<td><font size="5" align="center">Each processor has a socket type that must match the CPU socket on the motherboard — unsuitable processors do not fit into the incompatible motherboard. This effectively limits the upgradability of CPUs, as developers build new CPU sockets every few years.Whether you want to update your machine to an out-of-date socket, you'll need to replace the motherboard – a job as daunting as making a new computer – or purchase an older CPU that suits the motherboard.</font></td>
