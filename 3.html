		<h1> What does Machine Cycle mean? </h1>
		<h1>The machine cycle is the most simple process a computer performs, and the CPU must perform several cycles in order to complete trivial tasks such as displaying a single character on the screen. This is what the computer does from the moment it starts up until it shuts down..</h1>
		<h1>The steps of a machine cycle are: </h1>
		<h1>Fetch – The control unit requests instructions from the main memory that is located at the memory location as shown by the program counter. </h1>
		<h1>Decode – The instructions received are decoded in the instruction register. This involves breaking the operating field into its components based on the operating code of the instruction. </h1>
		<h1>Execute – It requires an opcode statement as it defines the appropriate CPU operation. The program counter shows the machine instruction series. All instructions are compiled in the instructions register, and each of them is executed.Increases the program counter so that the next command is stored in memory. Appropriate circuitry is then triggered to perform the necessary function. As soon as the instructions are executed, the system loop that begins the retrieval phase is restarted. </h1>
	    <h1> Store - Send and write the results back in memory. </h1>
