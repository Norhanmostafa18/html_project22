			<li><h1>In the field of computer engineering, computer architecture is a set of rules and methods that describe the functionality, organization and implementation of computer systems. Some architecture definitions define it as describing the capabilities and programming model of a computer, but not as a specific implementation. In other definitions, computer architecture involves instruction set design of the architecture.</h1></li>
			<li><h1>Computer architecture is concerned with balancing the performance, efficiency, cost, and reliability of a computer system. The case of instruction set architecture can be used to illustrate the balance of these competing factors. More complex instruction sets enable programmers to write more space efficient programs, since a single instruction can encode some higher-level abstraction .</h1></li>
			<li><h1>Nonetheless, longer and more complex instructions can take longer for the processor to decode and can be more expensive to execute effectively. The increased complexity of a wide collection of instructions often provides more space for unreliability as instructions communicate in unpredictable ways..</h1></li>
			<li><h1>The implementation includes the design of integrated circuits, packaging, power and cooling. Application optimization includes familiarization with compilers, logic design operating systems, and packaging.</h1></li>
